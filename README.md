## Installation & Setup
Mr. Marshmallow runs on top of Node.js v14 or higher. Please refer to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) for installation.

Once Node.js is installed, clone or download this repository. Open a terminal/command prompt window, go to the directory where you downloaded the repository, and type `node server.js`, which will run Mr. Marshmallow!

PM2, a Node.js process manager, is recommended to keep Mr. Marshmallow up and running. In the case of an unexpected shutdown, Mr. Marshmallow will be able to get right back up when your system starts! Please refer to [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/improving-dev-environment/pm2.html#installation) on how to set up PM2.

### A Note about Music Functionality
Starting with v0.9, Mr. Marshmallow uses new packages and requires the use of the "ffmpeg" application for the music commands to function properly. If you use an Ubuntu-based system, you may need to install the `build-essentials` tool before installing the needed music packages.
